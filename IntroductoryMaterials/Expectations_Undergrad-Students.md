# Welcome to Statistics Undergrad Research Summer 2023!


We expect students to work on summer research between 05/15/23 – 06/30/23. The schedule is flexible and will depend on the project.  Students are expected to meet with faculty advisors at least once a week. Local students are expected to attend weekly group meetings on Tuesdays at 1pm in Engineering E103.


Log hours (including meetings, work and research time) using TimeClock.  We want to pay you for the time spent on summer research! Log hours under “DI UG Research Summer 2023”. If you have questions or need to request back time, contact Adrian Macdonald (Adrian.Macdonald@colostate.edu).  Funding is capped at $1500/student.  

Reproducibility is important! Use markdown or script to save code.  Add comments or text for interpretability.  Take notes during meetings.  NOTE: We will cover reproducible research in more detail during group meeting.

Expect to work independently, learn new methods, debug code, find and read relevant literature.

Questions are expected and part of research.  But students should try to come up with their own solutions.  It never hurts to give things some time (aka sleep on it).

On Fri 6/30 9am - noon, we will gather and students will present their work.  More details later, but for now please save this date. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their work at CSU CURC (Celebrate Undergraduate Research and Creativity) in Spring 2024. With these events in mind, we encourage you to spend time each week working on your presentation/poster.  A suggestion is to present a few slides (1-3) each week while you are working on your project.
