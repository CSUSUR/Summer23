## Install Quarto

-   Quarto is compatible with popular tools such as RStudio, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebook. To get started, download Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

-   After installing, you can get started making a presentation in the tool of your choice. For this demo we will be using RStudio.

-   There are great resources for presentation [tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

## Getting Started

-   To get started making a presentation, simply create a new Quarto Presentation file (qmd) which is an option in the RStudio file drop down box.

-   Making a [reavljs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) presentation is recommended for maximum functionality.

## Creating slides

-   Quarto has the benefit of having both a visual mode and a source mode that you can switch between.

    -   Visual mode: The way things will look on the slides, more like a Word interface

    -   Source: Think RMarkdown, just source code

-   You can edit in both of these modes depending on your preference.

## Creating slides

-   The reavljs tutorial linked in the previous slides has great customization examples

-   Basics:

    -   Create a new slide with '##Slide_Title'

    -   Add a code block just like RMarkdown in Source mode or by selecting 'Code Cell/R' under the Insert drop down in Visual Mode.

    -   Add an image just like RMarkdown in Source mode or by selecting the picture icon in Visual Mode (a lot more user friendly!)
