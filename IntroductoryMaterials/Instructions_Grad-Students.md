# Statistics Undergrad Summer Research 2023

**Background:**
This summer the Statistics department will offer funded undergraduate research positions.   These students will meet regularly with faculty advisors to work on individual research projects. 

But we are also planning weekly “group” meetings to cover general interest topics.  We plan to develop “seminar”-style training materials.  We plan to reuse these materials in future summer undergraduate research sessions.

The group meetings will be held on Tuesdays at 1pm in Engineering E103 between 5/15 - 6/27.  Student presentations will be on Fri 6/30 9am-noon.  

** Katy and Brayden should decide who will cover which dates!  

**Expectations:**
Self-motivated to explore and develop materials supporting undergraduate research topics
Prepare engaging materials for 50 minute meetings, discussions.  
Send materials 1 business day in advance of meetings (Note: Memorial Day (5/29) and Juneteenth (6/19) are university holidays.)
Meet with Ann and Ben as needed.  Not sure we need to schedule regular times, but you should absolutely reach out! And if you want a regular meeting, say so. 
We need to find a way to store and share materials.  We are open to suggestions.  Git, Google site, Canvas “course”?

**Format for Group Meeting:**
Start with student check in. 
Start with a question for discussion.  What does reproducible research mean? How do we achieve it?
Depending on the topic, you may:
develop a FEW slides to facilitate content
provide a paper (appropriate level)
online resource
live demonstration.  

**Topics (examples):**
*Reproducible Research:* commenting code, Markdown, put in a small plug about importing directly from Excel.  Big picture ideas about reproducibility.  Brief Sweave intro? ggsave()?
Git 


*Making things look nice:* Tidyverse, ggplot2, kable, tidy(), summ()


*Presentation/Poster:* Preparing for closing presentation, looking at example posters.

*Doing research:* Reading a scientific paper, finding relevant papers, Zotero.

*Finding and working with unfamiliar R packages.*  This topic might be small enough to add with another larger topic. 

*Professional Ethics*

*Career opportunities, grad school*
